# Question 1
# You need to calculate the flight time of an upcoming trip. You are flying from LA to Sydney, covering a distance of 7425 miles, the plane flies at an average speed of 550 miles an hour.
# Calculate and output the total flight time in hours.

# Hint
# The result should be a float.

distance_from_LA_to_Sydney = 7425
speed_of_flight = 550
time_of_flight = distance_from_LA_to_Sydney / speed_of_flight
print(f"The total flight time from LA to Sydney is {time_of_flight} hours")
